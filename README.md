Designed to work with Fusion 360. 
v1 takes in individual subunits and creates sketches based on min/max values on the x,z,y plane
v2 has the user manually select the vertices of the sketch they want to extrude to. Results in a symmetrical subunits
Currently trying to fix v1's implementation so that it works for non-closed objects.
